// The express.json() function is a built-in middleware that adds a body property to the request (req.body). 
// The req.body request will contain the parsed dataâ€”or it will return an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type wasn't matched, or an error occurred.
// This middleware must come before any handlers that will make use of the JSON in the body of the request.

// Declare a middleware function.

// You will notice that the only difference in the below middleware is that the first parameter is err. The names of the parameters do not matter; instead, Express is looking for whether or not there are four parameters.
// If you try to access this function normally, you may have a hard time. The error-handler middleware only gets called in one of two cases:
// When there is a problem in the application itself (for example, if you made a mistake in your code).
// When you specifically trigger it using the next() function in a previous middleware function.
// No matter where you put this error handler, it will not be triggered unless one of the above conditions arises. Express does this so that you have a tool dedicated to handling issues that may arise.
// Always include an Express error handler function below the middleware that will catch any not-found routes.
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.send(`The route ${req.path} does not exist!`);
})
